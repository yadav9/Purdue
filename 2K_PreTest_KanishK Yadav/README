// ~ Introduction ~ //

In this program, I implemented Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the minimum amount
of time required to deliver messages throughout the whole kingdom. I thought
of time to reach from one city to another as distance (that's what I made weight
in my graph). I did this first by finding the minimum times (shortest distance)
to reach all cities from capitol city and returning the largest of all shortest
values. I chose the largest of all shortest values since by the time we reach the
farthest value, we would have visited every other place.



// ~ Getting Started ~ //

There are 3 files in the folder-
1) main.c - contains the entire code
2) Makefile - used for compilation of the file
3) README (this file)



// ~ Input Format ~ //

The program takes an input file with the information in format as described in
the Pre Test document.



// ~ Output Format ~ //

The program prints the result to the terminal. If required for testing, you can
get rid of extra printed stuff in findMinTimeToDeliverAllMsgs() in main.c and
just print the integer result.

// ~ Assumptions ~ //

The program assumes that input time will always be positive. It also assumes
that all cities are reachable using some path from capitol city. The program also 
assumes that the input time is an integer (int data type can hold its value
without overflow).



// ~ Summary ~ //

# Compile
> make

# Run
> ./main "Input Map File"
